# WARProxy

Use a single command to turn `Cloudflare WARP` into your SOCKS5/HTTP proxy server! 
The most minimal docker image includes all the features you might need!

Includes:
- WGCF: generate cf warp accounts and wireguard config automatically.
- WireProxy: create socks5 proxy.
- Warp+: refresh warp+ traffic.
- Health check etc.

## Usage

`docker`:

```sh
docker run --name warproxy \
  -p 1080:1080 \
  -d ghcr.io/thainguyen06/warproxy
```

or `docker-compose`:

```yaml
services:
  warproxy:
    image: ghcr.io/thainguyen06/warproxy
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 1080:1080
```

### To change license key
If you have an existing Warp+ license key, edit `/config/wgcf-account.toml` and,  delete two files :  
`/config/wgcf-profile.conf` and `/config/wireproxy.conf`  
When you restart container, it will update your account info and re-generate conf files automatically.
